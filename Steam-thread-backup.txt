🏡Vanilla Server (PVE) (Public)

A simple public server for everyone to enjoy 7 Days To Die latest version together.
There are many servers that come and go, if you want to stay and be connected with others that enjoy this game you are in the right place. We are always looking for help with the server so join Discord, leave a Steam comment here or contact me if you feel like. Maybe once EAC and Steam Workshop will be introduced into the game, together we will make community that also have interesting modded servers.
For now let's enjoy Vanilla Server.
