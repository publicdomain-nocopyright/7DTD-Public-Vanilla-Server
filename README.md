Migration and setup note  
Possible next host: https://server.unesty.net/
With discount, 16GB 4GHZ hosting might be able to support up to 8 players.  

If a root user uploads backup, it's needed that owner is changed to the linux user responsible in this case: "steam"  
```
ls -lh "/home/steam/.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/North Nuzaya County"
ls -lh "/home/steam/.local/share/Steam/steamcmd/7dtd/Data/Worlds/North Nuzaya County/"

chown -R steam "/home/steam/.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/North Nuzaya County"
chown -R steam "/home/steam/.local/share/Steam/steamcmd/7dtd/Data/Worlds/North Nuzaya County/"
chown -R steam "/home/steam/.local/share/Steam/steamcmd/7dtd/"
chown -R steam "/home/steam/.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves"

```
The second script of https://github.com/vaido-world/7daystodie-dedicated-server/blob/master/Minimal_setup.zip  
Can be adjusted for reuse on automated setup of Ubuntu 7 Days To Die Dedicated Server.  

This mod needs to be disabled or 8081 port forwarded to stop throwing ESC errors in-game. (add any word like [disabled] to the filename for it to not match xml files inside 7dtd `data` folder.)
